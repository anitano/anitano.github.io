My current area of research is workplace learning related to information practices. I have been conducted fieldwork in a trainee programme for newly graduated nurses in a hospital in Norway. This research focusing on nurses' information practices related to workplace learning is intended to contribute to improving information systems and training of new employees in health care. I have a background as a radiation therapist and have worked as head of the radiation therapy section at Oslo University Hospital for 14 years, mainly focusing on personnel recruitment and development. I have an MA in value-based leadership (2008). My thesis for this Master's degree focused on the affects of informal talk on organisational culture, leadership and power distribution in organisations. I have been a lecturer in various subjects. Over the past four years, I have worked as an Academic Librarian at University of Southeast Norway, in charge of training health professional students and staff in information searching, reference management and evidence-based practice.
